Hello World
===========

Population Vs. Sample
=====================

### Population

The entire set of items or outcomes that can be studied or observed.
E.g., All possible hands in a game of blackjack, or the streamflow measurements for all years in Boulder Creekâ€™s history. It is rare that we have the entire population to study, so more often we look at the Sample

### Sample
A subset of the population used to _infer_ information about the whole population.
E.g., The peak annual streamflows for Boulder Creek over the past 100 years (as opposed to all possible years).

Data Types
==========
Understanding data types is crucial for selecting appropriate statistical methods and visualizations.

## Continuous Data
Quantitative Data that can take any value within a range. Examples: Streamflow measurements, temperature.
## Discrete Data
Quantitative Data that can take only specific values, often counted as whole numbers. Examples: Number of cards in a hand, number of students in a class.
## Ordinal Data
Categorical Data with a specific order but no consistent difference between categories. Examples: Rankings, customer satisfaction levels, T-shirt sizes (Small, Medium, Large)
## Nominal Data
Categorical Data without a specific order. Examples: Types of playing cards (hearts, diamonds, etc.), colors.
