Hello World
===========

Population Vs. Sample
=====================

### Population

The entire set of items or outcomes that can be studied or observed.
E.g., All possible hands in a game of blackjack, or the streamflow measurements for all years in Boulder Creekâ€™s history. It is rare that we have the entire population to study, so more often we look at the Sample

### Sample
A subset of the population used to _infer_ information about the whole population.
E.g., The peak annual streamflows for Boulder Creek over the past 100 years (as opposed to all possible years).

Notice as the sample size increases, the histogram of the Sample looks more and more like the PDF from the population. A take home message from this is _small data sets can provide an innacurate view of the big picture!_

Data Types
==========
Understanding data types is crucial for selecting appropriate statistical methods and visualizations.

## Continuous Data
Quantitative Data that can take any value within a range. Examples: Streamflow measurements, temperature.
## Discrete Data
Quantitative Data that can take only specific values, often counted as whole numbers. Examples: Number of cards in a hand, number of students in a class.
## Ordinal Data
Categorical Data with a specific order but no consistent difference between categories. Examples: Rankings, customer satisfaction levels, T-shirt sizes (Small, Medium, Large)
## Nominal Data
Categorical Data without a specific order. Examples: Types of playing cards (hearts, diamonds, etc.), colors.
