# Introduction to Probability

Probability studies the likelyhood that an event (or range of events) happens, usually focused on random chance.

A common example is a standard 6-sided dice roll. Every outcome is equally likely, so each event has a P(X=x)=1/6 chance. 

We can plot these frequencies on a chart, and see there is a uniform probability of each event occuring. The area under the chart highlights the probability of an event or range of events
