how many std dev from the mean?



sampling and standard error and confidence intervals
==========================

When I'm estimating, I can calculate the Standard Error for different test statistics. 

If I calculate the standard error, I can relate this to a normal distribution and think what % of values fall in that. if I have a 95 percent confidence interval, than the actual test statistic should fall in my confidence interval 95% of the time...

would be fun do to with with 1 STDev (67% CI), and draw things from a set

Maybe two decks of cards and what are the proprtion of hearts? Draw 10 cards? calculate standard error?

Bernoulli variable:

mean = P (proportion)
stdev= P*(1-P)
