Data Types
==========
Understanding data types is crucial for selecting appropriate statistical methods and visualizations.

## Continuous Data
Quantitative Data that can take any value within a range. Examples: Streamflow measurements, temperature.
## Discrete Data
Quantitative Data that can take only specific values, often counted as whole numbers. Examples: Number of cards in a hand, number of students in a class.
## Ordinal Data
Categorical Data with a specific order but no consistent difference between categories. Examples: Rankings, customer satisfaction levels, T-shirt sizes (Small, Medium, Large)
## Nominal Data
Categorical Data without a specific order. Examples: Types of playing cards (hearts, diamonds, etc.), colors.
