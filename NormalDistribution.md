Normal Distribution
===================

The Normal Distribution is the basis for a lot of the methods we use in probability and statistics. The Normal distribution has the following properties

* It is symmetric around the mean (Î¼)
* The mean, median, and mode all are in the same location
* Approximately 68% of data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean, 95% within 2 standard deviations, and 99.7% within 3 standard deviations
* The total area under the curve is 1
